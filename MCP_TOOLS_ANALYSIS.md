# MCP Tools Analysis - JFrog Integration Status

## Overview
This document provides an analysis of the currently connected Model Control Protocol (MCP) tools, specifically focusing on JFrog remote tools availability.

## JFrog Remote MCP Tools Status

### Current Status: ❌ NO JFROG TOOLS DETECTED

After comprehensive analysis of all connected MCP tools, **no JFrog remote MCP tools** are currently available in this environment.

### What We Looked For:
- **JFrog Artifactory MCP tools** - For artifact repository management
- **JFrog Xray MCP tools** - For security and compliance scanning
- **JFrog Platform MCP tools** - For general JFrog platform integration
- **JFrog CLI integration tools** - For command-line operations

### Currently Available MCP Tool Categories:
1. **GitHub MCP Server Tools** (Multiple tools)
   - Repository management, issues, PRs, workflows, releases, etc.
2. **Playwright Browser Tools**
   - Web automation and browser interaction
3. **Bash/Shell Tools**
   - Command execution and file system operations
4. **File System Tools**
   - File viewing, creation, and editing
5. **Security Tools**
   - GitHub Advisory Database
   - CodeQL checker
6. **Generic Utilities**
   - Progress reporting and other utilities

## Implications for SBOM Testing

Since this is an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) testing repository, the lack of JFrog MCP tools means:

- ❌ No direct JFrog Artifactory integration for artifact management
- ❌ No JFrog Xray integration for vulnerability scanning
- ❌ No automated JFrog platform SBOM generation capabilities
- ❌ No JFrog CLI automation through MCP tools

## Recommendations

To enable JFrog integration for SBOM testing, consider:

1. **Configure JFrog MCP Tools**: Add JFrog-specific MCP tools to the environment
2. **Alternative Integration**: Use GitHub Actions with JFrog CLI for SBOM operations
3. **Manual JFrog Operations**: Direct JFrog CLI usage through bash tools if needed

## Analysis Method

This analysis was performed using the specialized `sec-agent` MCP tool, which is designed to analyze and list connected MCP tools. The agent systematically examined all available tools to identify JFrog-related capabilities.
